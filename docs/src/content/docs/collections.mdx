# All Collections

Below is a live list of all icon collections available from Iconify. You can use any of these collection prefixes with the CLI, for example: `relaxicons icons lucide` and `relaxicons add lucide:home`.

<CollectionsList />

Notes:
- This list is fetched at runtime from the Iconify API. If you're offline or the API is rate-limited, the list may fail to load.
- In that case, use the CLI: `relaxicons collections --limit 50` or `--json` to explore collections locally.

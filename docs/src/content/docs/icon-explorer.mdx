import IconGrid from '../../components/IconGrid.astro';


Browse multiple collections. Use search to fuzzy match substrings; optional filters restrict to starts/ends-with your query. Click Copy to get the CLI command.

<IconGrid defaultCollection="lucide" />

## Tips

- Combine search + starts-with for prefix scoping (e.g. `alert`).
- Switch collections to compare naming patterns. The list of collections loads live from Iconify, so all collections are supported.
- Output command copies in format: `relaxicons add <collection>:<icon>`.
